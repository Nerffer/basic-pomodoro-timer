# Basic Pomodoro Timer
Tried to make a basic Pomodoro timer (25 min / 5 min)
A simple Pomodoro Timer application built with Python and Tkinter for productivity, following the Pomodoro Technique. The app allows users to set work and break cycles and includes sound and notification alerts when the timer ends.

## Features
  - Work & Break Cycles: Set the length of work and break sessions (default is 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break).
  - Start, Stop, and Reset Controls: Simple buttons to control the timer.
  - Sound Notifications: Plays a sound when each session ends.
  - Customizable Timer: Change the work and break durations using the settings option.
  - GUI-based: Built using Tkinter for a graphical user interface.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pomodoro-timer.git
cd pomodoro-timer
```

2. Install Dependencies: You may need to install the following libraries if they aren't already installed:
```
pip install pygame
pip install tkinter
```

3. Run the application:
```
python pomodoro_timer.py
```

## Usage
  1. Start Timer: Click on the Start button to begin the work session timer.
  2. Stop Timer: Click Stop to pause the timer.
  3. Reset Timer: Click Reset to reset the timer back to the original work duration.
  4. Customize Cycles: Use the Settings button (top-right corner) to change the work and break durations.
  5. Sound and Pop-up Notifications: The app will play a sound and show a pop-up when a work or break session ends.

# Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique can improve focus and productivity.

  1. Work for 25 minutes (or your customized time).
  2. Take a 5-minute break.
  3. After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
